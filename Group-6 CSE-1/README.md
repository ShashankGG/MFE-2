## Abstract
We have chosen the topic “Trends In Funding of Indian Startups” for our project. The data
for our analysis has been taken from this [source](
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/indian-startup-funding).

We visualize data for five years(2015-2020) from various startups via graphs and use
hypothesis testing to answer some questions and to better understand the trends.

We have used R to analyze the data.
