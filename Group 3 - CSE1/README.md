## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Problem statement is based on the fact that cholesterol is known to increase the chances of having a cardiovascular disease. By downloading data on 70,000 people from internet, with attributes defining whether the subject had a cardiovascular disease or not, and whether he had low cholesterol (which is denoted by 1), moderately high cholesterol (denoted by 2) and high cholesterol (denoted by 3). A chi square test was then performed on this data, to determine the relationship between having low, moderately high and high cholesterol and having a cardiovascular disease.
